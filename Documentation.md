# Documentation about some git command

## Create a Repository for a Blank (New) Project:

To create a new local repository and apply version control we use: 
```
$ git init
```

## Make copy of existing repository: 
To make a local copy of a remote repository we use: 
```
$ git clone <repository URL>  
```
Usually, the original repository is located on a remote server, often from a Git service like GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab. The remote repository URL is referred to the origin.
